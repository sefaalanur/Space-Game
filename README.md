# Space-Game
Basic space game project
-As a first step, JFrame and JPanel were edited and the infrastructure of the game was prepared with shape design.
-Later, the game was integrated with the keyboard by typing the codes sequentially.
-Then the ball on the top is created and made movable with timer variable in each 5 miliseconds.
-A suitable spaceship png extension was downloaded and added to our file and included in the game and edited in the appropriate format made it movable with arrow keys.
-Later, the ability to shoot the spaceship was added, and this fire moves on the y-axis unlike the ball and the spaceship.
-Space key has been assigned to shoot, and each time it is clicked, our predetermined counter starts counting the shots.
-The last step, if our shot collides with the ball, stops the game and displays the time elapsed and the number of shots spent.
